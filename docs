# Cowrie pretending to be a real Linux server (hence the Debian welcome message).
# Cowrie logs whatever password is inputted, however it is not validated

# Example of a JSON log entry
# In this example, as the 'attacker', I inputted the password 'Beepbeepboop' when prompted by Cowrie. This is logged in real time in the cowrie.json file.
# The following command is used for formatting the JSON file:
# sudo tail -f /home/cowrie/cowrie/var/log//cowrie/cowrie.json | jq

# As the 'attacker' I ran some common commands that a real attacker may use to investigate the system.

# These commands were also logged in the cowrie.log file.
